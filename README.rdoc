== Welcome to Poortego

After doing the normal rails setup, e.g.,
$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate
(whatever else)

Currently to launch do:
$ cd ./app/views/CLI/
$ ruby ./launch_shell

This project just started, so there is a lot 'to do' ... see TODO in this CLI directory for command-line interface tasks.
Eventually once the CLI and general model are all working perfectly, I'll look at building a Rails web front-end.
