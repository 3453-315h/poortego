AutoType transform is working and responding correctly even if there are no actions to perform.

Finished building parse_entities_hash() and parse_links_hash() functions within poortego_transform_responseXML.rb
these functions are called from the parseXML() function, which is called in the poortego_transform_responseXML.rb initializer
if XML is passed in the constructor.  This happens in the run command handling the response from a transform call.

Have not tested the parse_links_hash() function within the poortego_transform_responseXML.rb

Suggested next steps are to:
(1) Note: the transforms are broken down into sub-dirs by type - need to add this logic in place ...
Right now the run_cmd.rb is hard-coded to launch the auto_type transform purely for testing purposes.
Need to change this logic to appropriately launch transforms against the proper entities/links and theit types.
- is it plausable that transforms can be run against links - if so, maybe have a sub-dir to differentiate entity
versus link transforms?


(2) Create another transform "dns_dig.rb" since this will create new entities and links it will be a better
transform test, and will also force me to move any hard-coded stuff into re-usable classes/methods for other
transforms to leverage without having to copy/paste.

 
Working in run_cmd.rb file to handle the XML response message,
building out a transform object from the response, then
looping through the responseEntities, responseLinks, and responseMessages
attempting to build Entity and Link objects from these response to then
store/update within the DB.

An XML response message is built from the autotype transform and is being used as the first test transform
to handle the response from
-- This is working for "IP Address" type
   -- Need to build out common types like "IP Address", "Domain", etc.
      -- Maybe have different grouping of types to include/exclude - ?

* To Do: intial transform building and testing:
-- Continue to update the autotype transform to get this working as our first transform!
-- Related to this is ensurance of logic that properly handles the reciept of the XML messages and takes the appropriate actions
such as creates, updates, deletes (can a transform delete entities?)

* To Do: Need a command to build a new poortego DB that will initialize the tables to include the types in the next TODO item

* To Do: Need to build out common entity and link types that are loaded into poortego databases during intializations
Such as: "IP Address", "Domain Name", "Netblock", etc., etc.
Need to have a standard naming convention too with capitalization, etc. - look at Maltego type names

* Bug/Issue: lib/rails/app/config/database.yml directly defines the path location of the default SQLite database
This should be modified to be a relative path from the POORTEGO_LOCAL_BASE environment variable.

* To Do: build out a simple transform based on "Transform_HOWTO" and kick it off using the "run" command from CLI

* To Do: build a transform_scheduler.rb tool in the root to run hourly in cron and run transforms that are scheduled

* To Do / Wish List: automate the unit testing of RexUI CLIs

* Bug/Issue: after we get poortego transforms working- take a look at supporting maltego

* Future feature: PHP/web UI

* Future feature - look at using this project for blocklist management
