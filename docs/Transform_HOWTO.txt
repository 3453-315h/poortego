| Transform HOWTO |
+-----------------+

NOTE: all transforms should return valid XML even if they ended up performing no action,
they can/should respond back with a transform message noting this fact for tracking purposes.

(1) Create sub directories under the main transforms directory where each sub-dir corresponds to an
entity or link type, e.g., "IP Address", "Domain", etc.

(2) Build a transform file that receives as it's arguments:
Argument 1: the entity/link value/title
Argument 2 (optional): the entity/link fields delimited by a '#'
Have the transform return a PoortegoTransformResponseXML object

Make sure you set the permisions of the transform to be executable:
$ chmod 775 xyz_transform.rb

(3) Set standard object fields for entities/links of interest as applicable, e.g.,

xyz_transform          = enabled (default), disabled
xyz_transform_status   = none (default), successful/failed run 2012/06/20 00:00:00
xyz_transform_message  = none (default), <Message>...</Message> 
xyz_transform_schedule = none (default), 123 hours/days 

The field/value pair need not be set if the default is to be used.

(4) Transforms that are enabled and have a status of 'none' are executed when on of these conditions occurs:
    (A) Transforms for the project, section, or object are requested to be run by the user ("run" command)
    (B) The transform scheduler program is run (should be setup in cron for every hour)

Note: the "run" command to manually run transforms only runs transforms for objects that are enabled
and have a none status AND for those that are scheduled and are past due. To force a "run" for all
enabled transforms regardless of status/schedule do a "run force" command.
    
(5) Transforms that are enabled, scheduled, and already have a status are run again
when the transform scheduler program determines that the transform is past due to be run.

| Transform Notes |
+-----------------+

Transform arguments are passed within single quotes, e.g., xyz_transform 'arg1' 'arg2'
-- This is to be able to pass things like spaces
-- Single quotes are escaped within the args like \', this is done within the "run" CLI command
-- The "run" CLI command also converts the '#' character in argument names/values as '%P_ESC%'
which is then returned to '#' within poortego_transform.rb, this is because the '#' character
is used as a delimiter for arg2 data
-- May need/wish to escape other characters that could negatively impact the command line
  -- This is not really secure and should not be exposed to anyone where arbitrary input can be done
