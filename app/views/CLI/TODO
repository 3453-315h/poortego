[-] Error while running command select: undefined method `id' for 1:Fixnum
CMD_Select - 126, home dispatcher 227

need to figure out link / link_to command ... use create/set/delete or separate cmd?

-=-=-

* remove un-needed commands to eliminate confusion:

- CMD_EntityType.rb logic should be moved to "set type <value>" command when current type is entitytype
- Same as above should exist for LinkType
- CMD_Field.rb logic should be moved to: create, set, delete commands
- Move Section Descriptor to create, set, delete commands


Note: the "back" command seems to break after about 3x use


-=-=-=-

To Do:

- Thinking about moving Section->Descriptor command to Field command


-=-=-=-

Moving commands into CMD files, did this for home_dispatcher, do this for other dispatchers, e.g., entity_dispatcher

Figured out tab completion ... see connect command
#1 Tab completion / filtering of things to select, linkto, delete, etc.
-- e.g., list eunews* to list anything begining with eunews
-- or, select eunews<tab> to auto-complete or show available options

#2 Need an ability of easily assigning entity and link types, I didn't do this when I build my graph
-- Auto detection of IP addresses, ASNs, Netblocks, MD5s, domains, paths, etc.

#3 Need transforms (they're tied though to entity/link types)

* Additional Functionality:
-- Tag certain fields and titles to be redacted, and have the ability to export a full or redacted report
-- Import of things like pcap and auto-generate the graphs
-- Ability to find intersections among Sections within a Project
-- Ability to find and link entities that have the same field/value pairs (maybe entities are a square, and circles are a field in the graph)

* Work on "entity" dispatcher
-- ensure link

* Modify "show" command to show fields
* Move some commands under project and section dispatchers versus home

* Update "delete" command to be recursive, so that when a project, section, etc. is deleted
all related things that are exclusively tied to these objects are also deleted 

* Test "field add/list/delete" for entity and links
* Test addition of links 
* Transform dispatcher needs to be done for transform manipulation
* Look at tab completion
* Add "back" command in Home dispatcher
* Add "run" and "export" commands in Home dispatcher
* Add "connect" command in Home dispatcher

* Make it easier to set descriptor and field values - ?
* Additional error checking / catch statements, e.g., in the "set" command in home dispatcher

* Ensure Standardized dispatcher help format (e.g., done for Home Dispatcher)
* Ensure Standardized comment format (e.g., done for Home Dispatcher)

 at msfconsole

Rex::UI::Console I believe

If too complicated - screw it, start off with IO::STDIN/STDOUT

Basic commands:
 - ? | h | help
 - list:
   - projects, sections, objects, links, fields, transforms
 - add:
    - project, section, object, link, field, transforms
 - print: display current table
 - edit: edit current object
 - run: 
    - transform <title>
 - delete: remove current object
 - import
    - csv <file>
    - xml <file>
    - json <file>
 - use <id/title/name>
